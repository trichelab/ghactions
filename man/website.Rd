\description{
This workflow renders some Rmarkdown via its (custom) site generator and deploys the result.
Suitable for:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html}{RMarkdown websites}
\item \href{https://bookdown.org}{Bookdown websites}
\item \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/}{Blogdown websites} (\strong{experimental})
}
}
\details{
\code{\link[rmarkdown:render_site]{rmarkdown::render_site()}} returns the directory to which outputs have been rendered.
This workflow saves that directory in the environment variable \code{DEPLOY_PATH}, which is the default expected by \code{\link[=ghpages]{ghpages()}} and other deployment methods.
