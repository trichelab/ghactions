\description{
These helpers produce the markdown text you need in your README to include
badges that report information, such as the CRAN version or test coverage,
and link out to relevant external resources. To add badges automatically
ensure your badge block starts with a line containing only
\verb{<!-- badges: start -->} and ends with a line containing only
\verb{<!-- badges: end -->}.
