write_workflow(x, file = stdout(), ...)

r2yaml(x)

read_workflows(path = ".github/workflows")

read_workflow(file, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\verb{[list()]}
as created by the workflow functions.}

\item{file}{either a character string naming a file or a \link{connection}
    open for writing}

\item{...}{arguments to \code{\link[yaml]{as.yaml}}}

\item{path}{\verb{[character()]} giving the directory from the repository root where to find GitHub Actions workflows.
Defaults to \code{".github/workflows"}.}
}
\value{
\verb{[list()]} of lists from yaml.
}
\description{
Reading and writing GitHub Actions workflow files
}
\details{
It is not necessary to escape characters with special meaning in yaml; the underlying \code{\link[yaml:write_yaml]{yaml::write_yaml()}} does this automatically.

If a workflow is \emph{not} \verb{name:}d, the file name will be used as a \verb{name: }, as per the \href{https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#name}{GitHub Actions documentation}.
}
